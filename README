Task 3
Why this framework and Features of Framework:
 
The framework is created in such a way where feature line in the feature file is mapped to the Java methods.
 
This framework can be understandable even by a non-technical person. This can be extended to UI automation, Fetch DB data, and provide excellent reports.
 
Each feature file is annotated with Cucumber tags we run whichever test we want just by placing the tag in the runner class
 
***************************************
How to run the framework?
 
Clone the project from Git Hub --> Import it to any IDE --> Go to Runner Package src/main/java -- TestRunner.java --> Right-click then Run as Junit

Utils
 
Src/main/Utils - Where Class for reading a property is created which is extended to a different class
 
Feature file

SRC
 
The property file is stored having a common URL

Scenarios covered
 
Finding href link and getting the status code of 2XX
Opening the Mytheresa site and logging with the dummy user created from the maildrop
